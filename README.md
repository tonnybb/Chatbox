# Chatbox
Created for Capstone Project  
Chatbox - http://vgm.herobo.com/chatbox/chatbox.html  
Here is a small web project I finished during a Capstone class. It’s a chatbox that allows web users to
talk to each other in real time using a browser. It uses a mix of many different
technologies. On the clientside it is using HTML, CSS, JavaScript​and Ajax​.
On the server side it is using PHP ​and a MySQL​Database.
You can see the chatbox in action by visiting the URL above (I’m using a free web host that is
a little iffy. You might have to reload the page a couple of times if the page won’t load).
